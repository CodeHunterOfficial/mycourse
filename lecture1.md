# Lecture 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data.

## Core Concepts

- **Supervised Learning:** Learning a mapping from inputs to outputs using labeled training data.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data without labeled responses.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learning how to act based on feedback from the environment in the form of rewards or punishments.
